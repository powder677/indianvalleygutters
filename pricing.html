      <div class="space-y-6">
         <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How often should I have my gutters cleaned in Pennsylvania?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">In Montgomery County, we recommend gutter cleaning twice per year - once in late spring after trees finish dropping seeds and debris, and once in late fall after leaves have fallen. Homes with many trees nearby may benefit from additional cleanings.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What if my gutters need repairs during the cleaning?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">We'll identify any issues during our service and provide you with a separate estimate for repairs. Our cleaning price never changes, but we'll always let you know if we spot problems that need attention to keep your gutter system working properly.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Do you offer gutter cleaning services year-round?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Yes! While fall is our busiest season, we provide gutter cleaning services throughout the year in Souderton, Lansdale, Telford, Harleysville, and surrounding Montgomery County areas. Weather permitting, we can clean your gutters in any season.</p>

         <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What makes your pricing different from other gutter cleaning companies?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Most companies require an in-person estimate and quote based on linear feet of gutters, home complexity, or debris amount. Our flat-rate system eliminates the guesswork - you know exactly what you'll pay based simply on whether you have a 1-story or 2-story home. No waiting for estimates, no surprise charges.</p>
